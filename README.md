# city-or-countryside 👏

## The Bootcamp´s Mid-term review becomes this little project in which you should choose your favourite place to be/live: City or Countryside!! 

### The initial exercise✔

A small web application where we can show if we are having a good day or if it is better not to come to our table today. 

We will have the whole browser window to paint a face with a background. At the bottom of the screen we will have a select where we will be able to choose between two states, smiling or sad, and a refresh button.

With the select we can change our mood.The Update button will do several things:

- It will pick up the new status from the select and paint it instead of the current one
- It will generate a random number of 100 at most and if it is an even number it will set the background colour to the correct yellow (#ffcc00) and if it is odd, we will use the Chilean fire orange (#ff9900).

### My adaptation of the initial exercise💪

A small web application where you can choose between city or countryside.
With the whole browser window to show a beautiful background picture of each.

In the middle of the screen we have a select where we will be able to choose between city or countryside, and a refresh button. The Update button will do several things:

- It will pick up the new place from the select and paint it instead of the current one.
- It will generate a random number of 100 at most and if it is an even number it will set the background to the city picture, and if it is odd, the background will be the countryside picture.
